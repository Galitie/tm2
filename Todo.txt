Guiding lights:
	What would Sabrina like? -> Accesories, outfits, cute stuff, creepy stuff

	Does it have the spirit of Tylermon 1?


Accessories:
	Robot riding the bunny


Sabrina likes:
	Robots
	Octopus
	Spiders
	Velvet
	Unicorns
	Bats


Features to make it playtest ready:
	Considering moving banish to top of screen and upgrade points to cards?
	
	Round animation - center of screen, go up to the corner?
	
	Make unlockables actually unlock something? Maybe? Not sure how much we will play
	so it might not be worth "hiding" content
	
	Constipated should go away after some amount of poop / bomb upgrades?
	- Not sure why but when I remove constipated to poop summon and bomber, it crashes the game
	- Tries to reference items that don't exist
	- Think it might be a cyclical resource bug(?)
	
	Outline texture cut off 
	Shield breaker add effect animation (Raam?)
	
	Bonuses:
		Comments about the bunnies, lethal company style
			- Most killable
			- Chunkiest boi
			- The poopiest
			- On a list
			etc.
		Save, play games to get achievements to unlock accessories???
			Unlock cards?
			When should it load and save?
			Load at main menu?
			Save at end of each fight/upgrade round?
			How to view achievements?
				Main menu?
			Popup for getting an achievement
			Achievement ideas:
				End game with 0 points
				total kills > 100, 1000, etc
				Reach 100 HP
				One shot another player
				Speed maxxed out (idk number here, but gotta go fast)
				All slime upgrades
				All Poop upgrades
				All block upgrades
				All crit upgrades
				# of poop summons (idk what number here)

Card ideas:
	Boxy looking shader was cool
	Rainbow
	Summons (Sabrina loves these generally) spiders, bats, ghosts
	Drop traps, bananas
	Turn all attacks into blocks
	Turn all attacks into charge attacks
	If you are in last place get bonus, first place get penalty
	Sparkles, glowing
	Extra damage at low health
	Teleport
	Chain lightning
	Crazy damage, only one hp
	Moves faster every 5 seconds of a round
	Auto repair bots
	Drop an egg, will hatch in 1 rounds and fight for you unless destroyed


General Ideas:
	Pick an egg, that determines starting body shape
	3 body shapes to choose from (or more if I have time)
	As they gain experience, they look cooler?
	Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
	Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
	Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
	Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
	Do upgrade cards determine looks? Does's it tell you?


Builds:
	Crit
		Crits more often, but less multiplier
	Life steal
	Block
	Poison
	Damage
	Attack Rate
	Summons


Playtest Notes:
	Carson solo play 9/4/2025
		Didn't know what poops do - add guns to ones that do damage?
		Didn't know what was shooting out the bullets (poops) confusing that it went through some folks and not others
		Wasn't clear on bomb card that it will hit himself
		Didn't know what crit mult was
		Success feedback on block needed
