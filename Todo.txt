	As they gain experience, they look cooler?
	Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
	Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
	Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
	Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
