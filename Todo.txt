Guiding lights:
	What would Sabrina like? -> Accesories, outfits, cute stuff, creepy stuff
	Is it fun?

	Add accessory to creature (Raam)
	More cards to test
	Show winner at end of round - make them dance

Todo:
	Make controller joystick work (eventually)

	Save, play games to unlock accessories
	Achievements, like get 0 points, total kills > 100 etc.


Card ideas:
	Summons (Sabrina loves these generally) spiders, bats, ghosts
	Change creature size, really big or really small - is this interesting? Was a little funny in TM1
	Poison slime trails? Slippery slime trails that speed the velocity up momentarily?
	Drop bombs, traps, bananas
	Turn all attacks into blocks
	Turn all attacks into charge attacks
	If you are in last place get bonus, first place get penalty
	Sparkles, glowing
	Extra damage at low health
	Blocking reflects damage
	Teleport
	Chain lightning
	Ghost twin, after death summon a ghost version of you that fights
	Exploding on death
	Crazy damage, only one hp
	Moves faster every 5 seconds of a round
	First hit is reflected back to the aggresor
	Auto repair bots
	Drop an egg, will hatch in 1 rounds and fight for you unless destroyed


General Ideas:
	Pick an egg, that determines starting body shape
	3 body shapes to choose from (or more if I have time)
	As they gain experience, they look cooler?
	Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
	Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
	Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
	Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
	Do upgrade cards determine looks? Does's it tell you?


Potential issues:
	Not getting enough HP boosts -> can you get this from other cards? Secondary attributte
	Does HP matter if you're not dealing enough damage because we now have sudden death


Builds:
	Crit
		Crits more often, but less multiplier
	Life steal
	Block
	Poison
	Damage
	Attack Rate
	Summons
		Poop
