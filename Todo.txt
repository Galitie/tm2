Todo:
Make attacks work
Goto & attack state
Make getting hurt work

Ideas:
Pick an egg, that determines starting body shape
3 body shapes to choose from (or more if I have time)
As they gain experience, they look cooler?
Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
Pick and pass upgrade card options?
Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
Do upgrade cards determine looks? Does's it tell you?
