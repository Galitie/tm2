Todo:
	Place logic - 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. based off of total player points 
	Add a charge attack and replace charges transition argument from basic attack to charge
	Figure out how to track and where to track abilities taken
	Figure out how creatures will choose their next state
	Letting players choose accessory options - one idea is to left and right press on an upgrade
	card to show a preview of what it will look like. Give each upgrade 1-2 options?
	Modes - Quickplay, Regular etc.
	Make multi-player work
	Controller
	Menus
	Naming creatures
	Creature colors
	Save, play games to unlock accessories
	Achievements, like get 0 points, total kills > 100 etc.


Ideas:
	Pick an egg, that determines starting body shape
	3 body shapes to choose from (or more if I have time)
	As they gain experience, they look cooler?
	Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
	Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
	Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
	Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
	Do upgrade cards determine looks? Does's it tell you?
