Todo:
	Rerolls limitations
	Concept of points
	Concept of rounds
	Modes - Quickplay, Regular etc.
	Figure out how to track and where to track abilities taken
	Figure out how creatures will choose their next state
	How to decide winner? Last one standing? There is a sudden death mode...
	Make multi-player work
	Controller
	Menus
	Naming creatures
	Creature colors


Ideas:
	Pick an egg, that determines starting body shape
	3 body shapes to choose from (or more if I have time)
	As they gain experience, they look cooler?
	Let players customize a character from the start? (Name/color...accessories?)
	Coop mode where you fight an NPC(s) or just against each other?
	Have multiple creatures? If so, they will need player outlines or something
	Different Idle options? Could bop, or dance or zone out etc.
	Do upgrade cards determine looks? Does's it tell you?
